# A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners

Explore a dataset from Kaggle containing a century's worth of Nobel Laureates. Who won? Who got snubbed?

## Project Description

The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. Surely, right?

The dataset used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle.
